## Employee Tracker App using MYSQL database.

Your Task


Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
Because this Challenge will require the use of the Inquirer package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: npm i inquirer@8.2.4.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
